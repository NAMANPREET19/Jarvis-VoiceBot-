Jarvis (AI Voice Assistant) is an intelligent voice-controlled assistant built with Python. It listens to user commands, understands natural speech, and performs real-time actions such as opening websites, playing music, and engaging in short AI-driven conversations.

The project integrates multiple technologies — speech recognition for voice input, text-to-speech for natural responses, and Azure’s AI inference API for generating smart, context-aware replies. It runs directly from the desktop terminal, offering an interactive and hands-free experience similar to modern voice assistants.

Jarvis is designed as both a practical tool and a learning project, combining core Python libraries with web automation and AI integration. It showcases how speech-based interfaces can simplify human-computer interaction while staying lightweight and customizable.
